# 🗄 Database Models

The application includes the following database entities:

- Inventory
- Employee
- Finance
- Partner
- Contact

Managed using **Prisma ORM**.

---

# 🔐 Data Validation

## Phone Validation

All phone numbers:

- Must contain exactly **10 digits**
- Only numeric values allowed
- Invalid requests are rejected before database insertion

Regex Used:

```regex
^[0-9]{10}$
```

---

## Input Sanitization

Phone fields automatically remove non-numeric characters.

Example:

```
987abc65@43
```

becomes

```
9876543
```

---

## Backend Validation

Every POST and PUT request validates:

- Required Fields
- Phone Numbers
- Empty Strings
- Invalid Data Types
